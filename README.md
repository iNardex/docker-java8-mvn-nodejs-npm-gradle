# docker-java8-mvn-nodejs-npm-gradle

I was unable to find an image which could build both java and npm projects with maven and gradle, so I created one myself.

This image is mainly to build projects which have java and nodejs in one umbrella (like liferay project). It contains java8, maven 3.3.3, nodejs, npm and gradle.
